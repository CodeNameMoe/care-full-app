# **_Care-Full App_** üè•üêàüê∂üêá

Welcome to Care-Full!

Having a sick pet is a stressful situation, on top of our already busy lives, this additional stress can make it difficult to remember the specific details of your pet's illness and their needs.

This app aims to alleviate some of the stress that comes with having a sick pet by providing the user with an easy way to track symptoms and medications and facilitate better communication with their vet.

**This README is for the front-end of the Care-Full app. If you would like to explore the back-end of the app please go to the [backend repository](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/final-project_back-end-team-con-cat-enate-room-7)**
