# **_Care-Full App_** 🏥🐈🐶🐇

Welcome to Care-Full!

This app was created as part of the School of Code bootcamp, a team of 6 animal lovers came together and began brainstorming what real world problem we wanted to solve. Soon we realised a common issue experienced amongst pet owners - remembering when specific symptoms began and tracking how many times a symptom has been experienced. This then led us onto talking about the difficulty of remembering when you need to administer medication and attend appointments. After lots of ideation and grand ideas, we pulled ourselves back to reality and came up with a viable product that we could plan and produce in only 4 weeks, this is the result.

Problem statement:
Having a sick pet is a stressful situation, on top of our already busy lives, this additional stress can make it difficult to remember the specific details of your pet's illness and their needs.

Solution:
This app aims to alleviate some of the stress that comes with having a sick pet by providing the user with an easy way to track symptoms and medications and facilitate better and more accurate in person communication when visiting the vets.

**This README is for the front-end of the Care-Full app. If you would like to explore the back-end of the app please go to the [backend repository](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/final-project_back-end-team-con-cat-enate-room-7)**

## **_Getting Started_** ✅

### **Backend**

The backend is deployed on Heroku however if you would like to run locally you will need to follow the steps below.

1. Git clone the backend repository by pasting the following into your terminal:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/final-project_back-end-team-con-cat-enate-room-7
```

2. Install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
  npm i
```

3. Copy your database (e.g. Heroku) URL into the .env file, following the format:

```bash
 DATABASE_URL = <Database URL goes here>
```

4. Create all tables in your database by running the following scripts in the terminal:

```bash
npm run createSymptomsTable
npm run createRemindersTable
npm run createPetsTable
```

5. To populate the tables you can achieve this by interacting with the front-end, you can either run this locally or host on a hosting platform - we recommend Netlify but you are free to choose your own. For assistance deploying on Netlify please [click here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/).

6. Finally, to run the server locally use the following script within your terminal:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

### **Front-end**

To run the front-end locally follow the steps below:

1. Git clone the front-end repository by pasting the following into your terminal:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/final-project_front-end-team-con-cat-enate-room-7
```

2. Remember to navigate to the correct folder: final-project_front-end-team-con-cat-enate-room-7

3. Install all necessary dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
  npm i
```

4. Start the app using:

```bash
  npm run dev
```
